## 3rd Party App Sources

- Aurora Store
  - Acts as a sort of package manager to get updates for a handful of apps you have installed every couple months (install Aurora -> update apps -> uninstall)

- APKMirror
  - Google Camera cannot be installed normally through Aurora Store on LineageOS. It is also a bundle and not a single APK, so cannot be installed normally via adb either. Use APKMirror's bundle installer app (can get this from Aurora Store)
    - Download camera APK on computer -> move file to phone -> use installer app

- For new microG versions: GitHub Release page -> download -> command line install
